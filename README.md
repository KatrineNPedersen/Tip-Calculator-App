## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned and continued development

This challenge was good practice for using input values to complete calculations and display the result in real time. I will continue to incorporate CSS grid in conjunction with flexbox in future challenges, as the blend provides the best outcome in challenges like these.
